# Progress Log

## Run ID: 239a4e5b-65f5-4688-9fa6-53acba5a98ff

### Completed Stories

#### Story 1.0: Set up project structure and dependencies
- Created trader/ directory with __init__.py
- Created tests/ directory with __init__.py
- Created pyproject.toml with pytest and mypy configuration
- Updated requirements.txt with beautifulsoup4, pytest, and mypy
- Typecheck passes with mypy trader/
- Created tests/test_structure.py with 7 structure tests
- All 16 tests pass (9 existing + 7 new structure tests)

### Codebase Patterns

#### Project Structure
- trader/ - Main package directory
- tests/ - Test directory mirroring package structure
- pyproject.toml - Project configuration with pytest and mypy settings
- requirements.txt - Dependency listing

#### Type Checking
- Use mypy with strict settings
- Add types-beautifulsoup4 for BeautifulSoup type stubs
- Python 3.9+ for full compatibility

#### Testing
- pytest as the test runner
- Test files prefixed with test_
- Test functions prefixed with test_
- Use pytest.raises() for exception testing
